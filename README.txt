Notes:
* The output file for the path will always be the name of the input file + _path.txt .
* If no path is found, the output path file will simply draw the level with no path drawn and have a message printed above the level.
* If these files are not present upon receiving our project, they will be generated after running the program.
* If no path is possible, it will print "No path possible!" to console
